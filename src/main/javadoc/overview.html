    implementation of the {@link javax.sound.sampled.spi} interfaces based on
    <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org" target="_top">FFmpeg</a>, a complete, cross-platform solution to record,
    convert and stream audio and video. It focuses on decoding audio from many supported encodings and file
    formats to signed linear PCM.<br>
    This documentation covers the Java part of the FFSampledSP library. You can find the native part
